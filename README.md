# Game checklist
✔️ The goal is to make as much money as possible by selling crops and milk. The game ends when the player earns 1,000,000 gold coins. Player can see instruction when game start and win message when reached the goal.

✔️ Player can see their stats (money, tool's level, lands, workers)

✔️ Inventory & shop system (buy, sell items)

✔️ Farming system (plant, harvest, decompose, see stats of each plants...)

✔️ Worker system (help the player to plant, harvest, clean decompose plants,...)

✔️ Tool system (boost harvest efficiency) - Every harvest gives 1 unit. 10% boost each level is "bruh" game design. Player should see changes when they upgrade their tool (100% per level or adjust the unit amount each harvest)

✔️ Offline timing

✔️ Can config (create, delete, modify) items, shop stocks, plants using Scriptable Object

✔️ Scaleable system, designed to be expandable (inheritance, interface, module,...). 90% code base are event driven game logics.

❌ Offline simulation (worker simulation) - Complex equation, requires time 

❌ CVS config for game designer - Implemented but too much overhead in terms of loading resources and making sure the game would work after modifying the config file, scriptable objects make sure there're no missing data and more efficient

❌ Unit test??? - For this limited timeline (crunch time) there's no room for automation testing.
